# 3rd practice: Neural Networks
* **Course**: Artificial Intelligence
* **University**: Universitat Rovira i Virgili

In this practice students will explore the following fundamentals of machine learning:
* Data analysis
* Preprocessing
* Basic desgin of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP)
* Training of neural networks
* Results analysis
* Decision making / Critical thinking

While reading this notebook, please note the following information:
* Each section (and subsection) has a title and a brief description of its contents.
* If a section (or subsection) title starts with `Student`, the student has work to do inside it, adding code and/or text.
* If the title of a section begins with `Teacher`, all its content (including subsections) is part of the work statement. Subsequently, it **MUST NOT** be modified.
* Sections must be executed in order.
* **<font color='lightgreen'>Please enter your full name in the next cell in this section and run it BEFORE going any further.</font>**

## External resources
Please, read the following tutorials to get an introduction to Google Colab and the Pandas library:
* https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb
* https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/mlcc/intro_to_pandas.ipynb

## Deliverable
It is an **individual** practice. The student only needs to deliver **this notebook** including the answers. The file must have as name `P3_[Name]_[Surname/s].ipynb`, replacing `[Name]` and `[Surname/s]` with those from the student.

## Evaluation
To be accepted, all practices delivered must contain at least **one solution with a preprocessing step** and **one solution with a modified neural network**.
A third solution with a second preprocessing step will be valued.
